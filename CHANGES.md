# Tool Continuation Fix - Version 1.1.2

## Summary of Changes

We've fixed an issue where the conversation would stop after tool execution, leading to a `done` event without further responses from the LLM.

## Implementation Details

1. Modified the `sendMessageStream` method in `src/llm/session.ts` to:

   - Track the state of tool execution within the conversation flow
   - Set the `tool_result` flag for tool result messages
   - Ensure conversation history correctly includes tool results
   - Make appropriate API calls to continue the conversation after tool execution

2. Added comprehensive unit tests in `src/llm/__tests__/tool-continuation.test.ts` to verify:

   - Tool execution and continuation in streaming mode
   - Legacy format tool calls with `<tool>` tags in streaming mode
   - Proper event sequence: tool_start → tool_result → content → done

3. Created a verification script (`verify-tool-continuation.sh`) to build and test the fix

4. Updated documentation:
   - Added implementation notes in IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md
   - Updated README.md with information about the tool continuation feature
   - Created this CHANGES.md file to document the changes

## How to Verify

Run the verification script:

```bash
./verify-tool-continuation.sh
```

The script builds the project and runs the unit tests, confirming that the tool continuation issue is resolved.

## Next Steps

1. This fix is ready to be released in version 1.1.2
2. Users should update to this version for proper tool continuation behavior
3. No further changes are required for this specific fix
