# Implementation Notes for Tool Continuation Fix

## Issue Description

In version 1.1.2, the conversation flow would stop after a tool execution, resulting in a `done` event without further responses from the LLM.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the `sendMessageStream` method in `src/llm/session.ts`. When a tool was executed, the conversation wasn't properly continuing after the tool result was provided.

## Solution Implemented

The fix involved modifying the `sendMessageStream` method to:

1. Properly track the state of tool execution within the conversation flow
2. Set the `tool_result` flag for tool result messages to help the model understand the context
3. Ensure that the conversation history is correctly maintained and includes tool results
4. Make appropriate API calls to continue the conversation after tool execution

## Testing Approach

We verified the fix using both:

1. Unit tests that mock the Anthropic API to validate the conversation flow logic

   - Tests for modern streaming mode tool execution
   - Tests for legacy format tool calls with `<tool>` tags

2. Manual testing script to validate with actual API calls

## Conclusion

The tool continuation issue has been resolved in version 1.1.2. The conversation now continues properly after tool execution, maintaining the expected flow of:

1. User sends message
2. Assistant identifies need for tool usage
3. Tool is executed
4. Tool results are provided back to the assistant
5. Assistant continues the conversation with a response incorporating the tool results

This fix ensures a seamless experience for users working with tools in their conversations.
