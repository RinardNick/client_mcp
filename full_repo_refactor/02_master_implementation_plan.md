# Master Implementation Plan for LLM Package Refactoring

This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for refactoring the LLM package from its current monolithic design to the proposed domain-driven architecture. Each step is designed to be incremental, testable, and manageable.

## Implementation Categories and Sequence

The refactoring is organized into the following categories, to be implemented in sequence:

1. **Infrastructure Components** (Foundation)
2. **Session State Management** (Core Data)
3. **Provider Domain** (External Integration)
4. **Tool Domain** (External Integration)
5. **Context Management Domain** (Business Logic)
6. **Message Routing Domain** (Orchestration)
7. **Server Management Domain** (Infrastructure)
8. **Session Manager Refactoring** (API Surface)

## Implementation Timeline Overview

| Category                    | Estimated Time | Dependencies                  | Risk Level |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| Infrastructure Components   | 1 week         | None                          | Low        |
| Session State Management    | 1 week         | Infrastructure Components     | Medium     |
| Provider Domain             | 2 weeks        | Infrastructure, Session State | Medium     |
| Tool Domain                 | 2 weeks        | Infrastructure, Session State | Medium     |
| Context Management Domain   | 2 weeks        | Infrastructure, Session State | High       |
| Message Routing Domain      | 1 week         | All previous domains          | High       |
| Server Management Domain    | 1 week         | Infrastructure, Session State | Medium     |
| Session Manager Refactoring | 2 weeks        | All previous domains          | High       |

Total estimated time: **10 weeks**

## Category Breakdown and Rationale

### 1. Infrastructure Components

**Description**: Implement core infrastructure for domain communication and state management.

**Components**:

- Command Bus
- Event Bus
- Dependency Injection Container

**Rationale**:

- Foundation for all future components
- Enables gradual migration of functionality
- Low-risk starting point with minimal dependencies

**Success Criteria**:

- Complete test coverage for all infrastructure components
- Demo of simple cross-component communication

### 2. Session State Management

**Description**: Implement the Session State Repository to manage session data.

**Components**:

- Session State Repository Interface
- In-Memory Repository Implementation
- Session Entity Models

**Rationale**:

- Core data model needed by all domains
- Enables controlled access to session state
- Low coupling with existing implementation

**Success Criteria**:

- Repository can store and retrieve session data
- Session operations are properly encapsulated
- Basic events for state changes

### 3. Provider Domain

**Description**: Refactor provider management into a separate domain.

**Components**:

- Provider Manager Interface
- Provider Factory
- Provider Registry
- Provider Adapters

**Rationale**:

- Already somewhat isolated in current design
- Critical for core functionality
- Can be tested independently

**Success Criteria**:

- All provider operations work through the new domain
- Tests pass for all provider functionality
- No direct dependencies on SessionManager

### 4. Tool Domain

**Description**: Refactor tool management into a separate domain.

**Components**:

- Tool Manager Interface
- Tool Registry
- Tool Execution Engine
- Tool Validation

**Rationale**:

- Natural extension after provider domain
- Clear boundaries with other domains
- Important for functional testing

**Success Criteria**:

- Tool registration and execution work through the new domain
- Tests pass for all tool functionality
- Tool/Provider interaction uses command bus

### 5. Context Management Domain

**Description**: Refactor context optimization into a separate domain.

**Components**:

- Context Manager Interface
- Token Counter
- Strategy Selector
- Optimization Strategies

**Rationale**:

- Complex business logic
- Breaking circular dependencies with summarization
- High value for maintainability

**Success Criteria**:

- Context optimization works through the new domain
- Tests pass for all context strategies
- No circular dependencies with other domains

### 6. Message Routing Domain

**Description**: Implement message routing and processing logic.

**Components**:

- Message Router Interface
- Stream Processor
- Response Formatter
- Tool Call Handler

**Rationale**:

- Orchestrates interaction between domains
- Depends on most other domains
- Central to core functionality

**Success Criteria**:

- Message routing works through command bus
- Tool call handling properly delegated
- Integration tests pass for complete flow

### 7. Server Management Domain

**Description**: Refactor server management into a separate domain.

**Components**:

- Server Manager Interface
- Server Launcher
- Server Discovery
- Server Pool

**Rationale**:

- Relatively isolated functionality
- Lower priority for core operation
- Significant impact on codebase size

**Success Criteria**:

- Server operations work through the new domain
- Tests pass for server lifecycle management
- Clean integration with session lifecycle

### 8. Session Manager Refactoring

**Description**: Update the SessionManager to use the new domains.

**Components**:

- Session Manager Interface
- Session Factory
- Session Registry
- API Adapters

**Rationale**:

- Final step to connect all domains
- Preserves backward compatibility
- Maintains public API contract

**Success Criteria**:

- All functionality works through new architecture
- All tests pass (existing and new)
- Reduced codebase size
- Clear domain boundaries

## Individual Implementation Plans

For each category, detailed implementation plans will be created in separate documents:

- `03_infrastructure_components_implementation.md`
- `04_session_state_management_implementation.md`
- `05_provider_domain_implementation.md`
- `06_tool_domain_implementation.md`
- `07_context_management_domain_implementation.md`
- `08_message_routing_domain_implementation.md`
- `09_server_management_domain_implementation.md`
- `10_session_manager_refactoring_implementation.md`

Each plan will break down the implementation into small, testable steps following this structure:

1. Interface definition
2. Unit tests for the interface
3. Implementation of key functionality
4. Integration with existing code
5. Migration steps
6. Comprehensive testing

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified:

1. **Regression in Functionality**: Mitigated by comprehensive testing after each step
2. **Scope Creep**: Mitigated by clear boundaries for each domain
3. **Performance Impact**: Monitored through performance tests
4. **Learning Curve**: Addressed through documentation and examples
5. **Timeline Slippage**: Managed by prioritizing core functionality

## Success Metrics

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. The core functionality works identically to the current implementation
2. All tests pass, including existing and new tests
3. The codebase is more maintainable (reduced cyclomatic complexity)
4. The SessionManager is reduced to managing session lifecycle
5. Clear domain boundaries are established
6. No circular dependencies exist between domains
